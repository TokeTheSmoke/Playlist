The program loads track titles from a text file (playlist.txt) and stores each title in a dynamically allocated singly linked list. Once the playlist is loaded, it prints all tracks to the console for inspection. The program then demonstrates basic list manipulation by removing a track at a specified index and inserting a new track at another position in the list. After these modifications, the updated playlist is saved to an output file (playlist-out.txt).
